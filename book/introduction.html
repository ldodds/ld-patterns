This book attempts to add to the steadily growing canon of reference documentation relating to Linked Data. Linked Data is a means of publishing &quot;web-native&quot; data using standards like HTTP, URIs and RDF. The book adopts a tried and tested means of communicating knowledge and experience in software development: the design pattern. The book is organized as a pattern catalogue that covers a range of different areas from the design of web scale identifiers through to application development patterns.
