Understanding its limitations allows it to be used where appropriate and avoided when other techniques like <a class="link" href="named-graphs.html" title="Named Graph">Named Graphs</a> are a better fit.</p><p>RDF triples cannot be directly annotated. Reification is a modelling approach to dealing with this that involves changing the structure of the model. Each triple that needs to be annotated is instead modelled as a resource in its own right; an instance of the rdf:Statement class. The statement resource then has subject, predicate, and object properties that describe the original triple; additional properties can then be added to annotate the statement.</p><p>The obvious limitation of this approach is that the data model no longer contains a simple set of triples, instead it contains <span class="emphasis"><em>descriptions of triples</em></span>. The triples themselves have not been explicitly asserted. This makes a reified model harder to query, more difficult to manipulate, and at least three or four times larger in terms of number of triples.</p><p>In contrast to reification the <a class="link" href="named-graphs.html" title="Named Graph">Named Graph</a> pattern offers a data management approach to annotating triples or sets of triples, by associating them with a URI which can itself be the subject of additional assertions.</p><p>So where is reification best used? Current practice seems to suggest that reified statements are best used as a technique for describing changes to the structure of a graph, e.g. statements that have been added or removed, along with additional properties to indicate the time of the change, etc. In other circumstances it is best used with a reasoner or rule engine that can support surfacing the original triples, thereby simplifying querying. But this still comes with a cost of increased storage as well as potential performance issues.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm705"></a>Related</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="named-graphs.html" title="Named Graph">Named Graphs</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="qualified-relation.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="modelling-patterns.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="repeated-property.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Qualified Relation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Repeated Property</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
